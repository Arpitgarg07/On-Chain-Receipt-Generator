# On-Chain Receipt Generator

## Project Description
This project is a blockchain-based application that generates and stores transaction receipts on-chain. The project includes a smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to generate receipts for their transactions. These receipts are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Smart Contract Address
The deployed smart contract can be found at the following address:

```
0x22eBb3e8faf00C59D9D3818B335bbF4bA8ab4821
```

## Features
- Generates transaction receipts on-chain
- Stores receipts permanently on the blockchain
- Provides transparency and immutability for transactions

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask (or any other Ethereum wallet)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
